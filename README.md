# TIC-TAC-TOE

## Tic Tac Toe Game

The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their respective symbol (usually 'X' or 'O').

## Features

- Interactive Gameplay: The game provides an interactive interface where two players can take turns making their moves.

- Player Turns: The game alternates between the players, allowing each player to place their symbol on an empty cell of the grid.

- Win Detection: The game detects and declares a winner when a player successfully forms a line of their symbols.

- Draw Detection: If all cells are filled and no player has formed a line, the game recognizes a draw and ends the game.
